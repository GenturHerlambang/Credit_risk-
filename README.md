##Credit Risk Analysis
This project aims to analyze credit risk and determine the likelihood of a person defaulting on their loan. The Jupyter Notebook h8dsft_P1M1_Gentur_Herlambang.ipynb contains the detailed steps taken to explore, preprocess, model, and evaluate the credit risk dataset.


#Introduction
Credit risk analysis plays a crucial role in the lending industry, helping lenders assess the potential risk associated with extending credit to individuals. This project focuses on analyzing a credit risk dataset to build a predictive model that can assess the likelihood of loan default. By identifying high-risk borrowers, lenders can make more informed decisions to mitigate potential losses.

#Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis is available at Credit Risk Dataset. It includes information about various factors related to borrowers, such as their age, income, loan amount, loan purpose, credit score, and loan status (default or non-default).

#Key Steps
The project involves the following key steps:

- Data Exploration: Perform an initial exploration of the credit risk dataset to understand its structure, features, and distribution of loan default cases.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Feature Selection: Select relevant features that are most likely to impact loan default and remove any redundant or irrelevant ones.
- Model Building: Build a machine learning model, such as logistic regression or random forest, to predict loan default based on the selected features.
- Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the model using appropriate evaluation metrics and techniques, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Interpretation and Insights: Analyze the results to gain insights into the factors that contribute most significantly to credit risk and the model's predictive power.
